## Overview
[MyFlightPrice](https://myflightprice.herokuapp.com/) is a Flask web app which can predict your flight price based on the required information. Price may vary based on Source & Destination cities, Stops, Departure and Arrival Date & Time. Random Forest Regressor is implemented to predict the price of a flight.
